    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>Equipment</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 cast iron
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><Strong>Ingredients</Strong></h3>

    <h4><Strong>Marinade</Strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic smashed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><Strong>Other Ingredients</Strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>40 g yellow onion thinly sliced</li> 
        <li>2 tbsp green onion</li>
        <li>5 cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>5 slices cucumbers</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pate</li>
        <li>1 baguette</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><Strong>Directions</Strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a Ziploc bag (plastic bag). Shake it until everything is mixed and the steak is coated. Set aside at room temperature to marinate for 30 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>While the steak is marinating, cut your onions and green onions.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a cast iron pan over medium high heat. If you don’t have a cast iron, a non stick pan should work as well. Place the steak in the pan and let it cook until it gets a good sear (3-5 minutes).
        </li>

        <li>Flip the steak over. Add the butter. Spoon the melted butter over the steak. This will help cook the steak further and give it a nice sear. Once the steak has a nice sear on the second side, make sure to sear all the other sides too. The steak should be a medium rare to medium at this point. If you want to cook the steak more, put the steak in the oven for a few minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Once the steak is cooked to your preferred doneness, place it on a cooling rack to rest. This ensures that all the juices don’t flow out when you cut into it.
        </li>   
        <li>Next, cook your onion and green onion. Throw them into the cast iron and cook until the onions are translucent. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Next add the tomatoes and cook for a few minutes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Lastly, fry the egg. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain excess oil from the pan and place the steak, onion, green onion, tomatoes, and egg back into the cast iron. Add the cucumbers, pate, and baguette. </li>
        <li>Serve the bò né in the cast iron!</li>
    </ol>
